   * A use of a non-constant field is an active use of only the class or

   * in a class may be referred to via a subclass. A field declared in an
   * interface may be referred to via a subinterface or class that implements
   * the interface. These are passive uses of the subclass, subinterface, or
   * class that implements the interface--uses that won√≠t trigger their
   * initialization. They are an active use only of the class or interface in
   * which the field is actually declared. Here is an example that illustrates
   * this principle:
